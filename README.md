# Quick Description

**Programmer:shipit:**: Zakaria Abdelmoiz DAHI, University of Malaga, Spain. 

**About:** This repositiory implements the fully quantum, quantum-inspired and simulated evolutionary algorithm devised and studied in [1] that solves the users' mobility tracking in cellular networks.

## **How :green_book:** 

- Depending on what you want to study or used, you can navigate to the folder `TD-EA` for running the devised algorithm or `SOTA` for running state-of-the-art algorithms.
- Tehn, you just need to run the Matlab script `main.m`.

## **Folders Hiearchy :open_file_folder:**
    
- `Proposal`: contains the code of the devised approach.
- `SOTA`: contains the code of `Population-based Incremental Learning`.
- `Benchmark`: contains the details of the 15 cells network.
- `Results`: Once executed the results are stored in excel files with name Network_a_bxc, where a represent the ID of networks of such shape, b and c represent the number of cells in the width and height of the network.

## **Demo :movie_camera:**
- Please refer to the original paper [HERE](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X21004969) for more detailed results and discussions.

## **Notes:**
- It is prefered that you use Matlab R2014a to run the code as it is. 
- If you use newer versions of Matlab, you will probably need to update some obselete functions such as ```Mat2Cell```.
